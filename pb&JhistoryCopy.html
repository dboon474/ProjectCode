        <p>Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, or PB&J for short, have been a popular lunchtime staple for generations. The combination of creamy peanut butter and sweet jelly has delighted taste buds and satisfied hunger since it was first created.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box2">
        <p>The origins of the PB&J can be traced back to the late 1800s, when a doctor named John Harvey Kellogg created a peanut butter and jelly-like spread as part of a vegetarian diet for his patients. However, it wasn't until 1901 when 
         peanut butter was first sold in jars, making it more widely available to the general public.</p>

        <div class="box3">
        <p>The peanut butter and jelly sandwich as we know it today was popularized during World War II, when it became a cheap and easy way for soldiers to get a quick and filling meal. After the war, 
        the sandwich's popularity continued to grow, and it eventually became a staple in lunchboxes and on lunch menus across the United States.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box4">
        <p>Today, the PB&J remains a beloved and iconic food, enjoyed by people of all ages. Its simple yet satisfying flavor has made it a classic that will likely continue to be enjoyed for generations to come.</p>
